                     <h2>I. Defining Our Design Domain</h2>
                     <p>Our Design Domain is mobile applications for elderly healthcare.</p>
                     <p>After conducting initial research on healthcare applications, we have uncovered the following three insights:</p>
                     <p>— Healthcare applications are becoming more popular and increasing in demand among the elderly, as older individuals are becoming <b>increasingly adept</b> at using technology and are showing more interest in <b>technology-supported health services</b>.</p>
                     <p>— Digital Natives are entering a phase where they are responsible for caring for their children and elderly parents. Since they have grown up with the convenience of services, such as Uber and TaskRabbit, they seek out similarly <b>convenient digital solutions</b> to manage their caregiving responsibilities.</p>
                     <p>— Healthcare professionals should strive to maintain the <b>autonomy</b> of their elderly patients. However, their autonomy is often compromised within healthcare settings. To promote autonomy, it is crucial to provide them and their caregivers with sufficient information to make informed decisions about their care.</p>

                     <h2>II. Conducting Extensive Research On Our Target User</h2>
                     <p>An elderly patient tends to <b>accumulate multiple health issues</b> that become more devastatingly difficult to follow when accumulated. As a result, they are often demanded to manage multiple medications to combat their multiple health issues.</p>
                     <p>PillPal is intended for elderly patients who <b>struggle with medication adherence</b>. PillPal is particularly useful for elderly patients who are demanded to manage multiple medications and have a <b>complicated medication schedule</b> that require frequent administration. Additionally, PillPal is intended for elderly patients who desire to maintain their autonomy.</p>

                     <p>We used User Flow to map out the steps of an elderly patient <b>managing their pill management</b> on PillPal.</p>
                     <p>By mapping out our User's journey through PillPal, we can identify any steps that are confusing or difficult to complete, and redesign them to be more friendly for them. User Flow also helped us to <b>simplify processes</b> and reduce the cognitive load on them.</p>

                     <p>Since PillPal is heavily time-based, our team redesigned the display of their medication schedule into a linear timeline with a <b>progress bar</b>, <b>progress check-points</b>, and <b>horizontal scrolling</b> to show + hide more information on their medication schedule.</p>

                     <p>Our team performed In-Person Thinking Aloud Testing with 4 User Participants, 3 of which are <b>elderly patients</b> with certain medication condition(s) and 1 is a daughter monitoring the health of her parents. For our elderly patients, we recruited those who have been dealing with no support from their healthcare professional. Additionally, we recruited a daughter of one of our elderly patients to gain insights from <b>the perspective of a caregiver</b>.</p>
                     <p>Additionally, the team recruited 1 elderly patient with hypertension and 1 adult who monitors his own health. Since Remote Testing required them to download ProtoPie Player on their mobile device, the team recruited those who <b>feel more comfortable setting up mobile applications</b>.</p>
